\lee{Lee will take a stab at this. The main point of this paper is that there
  has been a long history of ``safe C'' languages that involved building new
  compilers. They allow low-level programming while ensuring type-safety. We
  show that with a modest set of generic type-level features, such a language
  can be built as an EDSL in which the safe-C type system is embedded in
  Haskell's type system, with a small number of exceptions. We'll also talk
  about some of the benefits and detriments of a safe C EDSL as opposed to a
  stand-alone compiler. In some sense, this is a follow-up to Stephanie's ICFP
  keynote showing what you can do with Haskell's dependent types (meaning
  decidable type inference in our usage).}
