\section{A Safe-C EDSL}
\label{sec:edsl}

\lee{Focus on some of the benefits/detriments of an EDSL for a safe-C
  language. Try not to overlap too much with last year's paper.}

\lee{Lee: describe line number insertions (overcoming a bad thing), module
  system (hack), the use of TH to make a concrete syntax, macros (e.g., standard
  lib---compare to Rust), other uses of macros, small compiler.}
