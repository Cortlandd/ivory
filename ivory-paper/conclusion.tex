\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have described a full-featured EDSL language for
high-assurance embedded systems programming. Ivory's type system enforces safe C
development, but as an EDSL, the programmer still has the flexibility to create
high-level constructs.

We have demonstrated the feasibility of developing large embedded systems in
Ivory ourselves, and there is a growing developer community.\footnote{Ivory is the
second most popular Galois-owned repository on Github, after Cryptol~\cite{}.}

That said, there are a variety of improvements we have considered for the
language. For one, there are plans to integrate SMT solving into GHC's
type-checking, allowing us to generalize Ivory. For example, the correctness of
array slicing can be guaranteed statically.
