\section{Ivory Semantics}
\label{sec:semantics}

\lee{Simon: this is yours. Give the typing rules for Ivory, sketch the proofs of
  progress and preservation, and describe this embedding in Isabelle. Also
  describe the (work-in-progress) to extend Ivory with memory regions and
  relaxed references. I'm expecting this'll be about 1-2 pages. Talk about a
  little additional type-checking at value level (return statements), discovered
from formal modeling.}
