\section{Ivory Overview}
\label{sec:ivory-overview}

\lee{Here, we'll give the main overview of Ivory without worrying about
  describin how it is implemented. We want to say what you can and cannot ``do''
  in Ivory. Also, let's give a taste of the programmer interface, e.g., how to
  define a struct, a procedure, bit data, write an array map, deal with extern
  data/procedures. I expect this'll be about 1 page, maybe 2. In some sense, the
content will be kinda like Iavor's intro in his Habbit/Hobbit/whatever
paper. It'll be more of an informal, almost tutorial style.}

\lee{We should cover everything describe in
  Section~\ref{sec:ivory-embedding}. In addition, we should cover pre-post
  condition, assertions, bit-data, safe and casting.}

\lee{I think a good guide for this section is Sec. 2 from the Shake paper:
  \url{http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/downloads/paper-shake_before_building-10_sep_2012.pdf}}

\lee{Pat: maybe you could take a stab at this one?}
